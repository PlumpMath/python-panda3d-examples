The goal of the project is to provide practical examples and tutorials for the [Panda3D](http://www.panda3d.org/) python game engine. This project is being run under the auspices of the [Python Project for the Google Highly Open Participation Contest](http://code.google.com/p/google-highly-open-participation-psf/)

Panda3D is a 3D engine: a library of subroutines for 3D rendering and game development. The library is C++ with a set of Python bindings. Game development with Panda3D usually consists of writing a Python program that controls the Panda3D library.

Interested parties should first read the GettingStarted wiki page.

There is a wiki page with proposed TaskIdeas. These task may fall on the advanced/difficult side.

# Finished Tasks #
